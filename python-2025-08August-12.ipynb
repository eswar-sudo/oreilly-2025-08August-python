    "# Functions vs. methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are types of verbs in Python. The difference is whether they are attached to a value (i.e., a method) or whether they're free floating (i.e., functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the verbs in Python are actually methods, and we'll see list methods today! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of functions, though, and those tend to be the most common things we want to do, such as `print` and `input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In use, we invoke a function and pass zero or more arguments in its `()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myfunc()\n",
    "    myfunc('a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "    myfunc(10, 20, 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are functions, and we use them, and we invoke them this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOWEVER, we might make the mistake of invoking a function with the wrong kind of argument value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    len('abcd')  # this returns 4\n",
    "    len(1234)    # this gives us an error, because integers have no \"len\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are tightly coupled with a data type, reducing the chance that we'll have an error of this sort. We always invoke methods after a `.`, which itself comes after a value (either the value itself or a variable):\n",
    "\n",
    "    data.method()\n",
    "    data.method('a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "    data.method(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the method isn't appropriate for the value, then we'll get an error saying that it doesn't exist. We won't get the \"inappropriate\" or \"bad value\" sort of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods come from object-oriented programming, where we try to organize our code such that data and functions (methods) are defined together. That's an organizational technique."
