    "# What is a programming language? What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were invented, people would build a new, separate computer for every problem they had to solve. That was time consuming and expensive! At some point, they decided to create general-purpose computers that could solve many problems. The way that such a computer could solve different problems was by writing *software*. In those days, you would write the 1s and 0s (\"binary code\") that the computer can use for instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty quickly, people decided that it would be better for us to write in a \"higher-level\" programming language, and convert that language into 1s and 0s. There are many, *many* programming languages out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C -- executes very quickly, because even though it's a higher-level language than 1s and 0s, it's still very tied to hardware and how it works. C is thus very hard to learn and often hard to use, but when you get things working, it runs very fast.\n",
    "- C++ -- C with object-oriented facilities for organizing your code in a modern way, using \"objects.\" C++ is a very, *very* complex language, far more even than C.\n",
    "- Java -- tries to remove some of the hardware thinking from programming, and is higher level. Java requires that you know how to use objects, and that can be complicated.\n",
    "- C# -- Microsoft's version of Java.\n",
    "- Python -- very high level language. It's not intended to execute super fast. It's intended to be easy to learn, consistent, and easy to read/debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been around for more than 30 years! But only in the last decade has it really taken off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a perfect language for an age in which computers are cheap and people are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code might not execute super fast, but it makes you very productive, which means that it's a good investment for many companies (for many individuals, too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become very popular in a number of domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning and AI\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Devops\n",
    "- Web applications\n",

    "- Testing and automation\n",
