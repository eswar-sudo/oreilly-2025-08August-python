    "When computers were invented, people would build a new, separate computer for every problem they had to solve. That was time consuming and expensive! At some point, they decided to create general-purpose computers that could solve many problems. The way that such a computer could solve different problems was by writing *software*. In those days, you would write the 1s and 0s (\"binary code\") that the computer can use for instructions.\n",

    "Pretty quickly, people decided that it would be better for us to write in a \"higher-level\" programming language, and convert that language into 0"
